# MinimalMainMenu

Minimal Main Menu is a KSP mod that removes the animations that occur in the main menu and 
combines both main menu pages by removing lesser used options.

In order to fit all options onto a single page,
the following menu items have been removed:
* Community
* Addons
* Merch
* Mission Builder (It can be accessed from Play Missions)
